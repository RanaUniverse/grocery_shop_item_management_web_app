<!-- here i will keep how the database will works and the database's structer and so on.
The database idea will be written here. -->

# Database Design
It will be `products` & `category` & `user`.

## How to use SQLITE DATABASE?
For sqlite i dont need to do anything special, in the create_engine() function i need to give teh path of the database name only.

## How to use POSTGRES?
For postgres i need to start the service first and then come to use this.
suppose database name is: `grocery_db`
So in this case first i need to make sure this is exists and postgres is running.
```
sudo systemctl status postgresql
```
If it say not started or inactive then i need to run this service first with below command:
```
sudo systemctl start postgresql
```
If i dont start this service it will shows the connection refused.

### How about making a database in the postgres?
```terminal
rana@laptop:~$ sudo -iu postgres
[sudo] password for rana: 
postgres@laptop:~$ psql
psql (18.3 (Ubuntu 18.3-1.pgdg24.04+1))
Type "help" for help.

postgres=# 
postgres=# 
postgres=# create database laptop_data owner rana;
CREATE DATABASE
postgres=# 
```

## Using Alembic
I will use alembic so that in future i can easily upgrade to new tables, columns and so on.

```
alembic init alembic
```
After running this upper i need to change some configuration to allow alembic make table's in my database.

```
alembic revision --autogenerate -m "initial migration first time"
```
Thsi will generate the some files in the alembic/versions/*py file.
```
alembic upgrade head
```
This will do changes the structer of the database and from then i will able to add new data in the database.

then i will change the model in my code and do follow the upper things again.




# 🗄️ Database Design

## 📦 Products Table

- id_
- name
- category_id

- sell_price
- mrp
- discount_percent
